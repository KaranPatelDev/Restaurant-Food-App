## Introduction

Welcome to the Restaurant Food App! This is a full-stack application that allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, and manage their food delivery experience. This guide will walk you through every feature step-by-step, perfect for beginners who want to understand how to use the application effectively.

### What This App Does
- **For Customers**: Browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, track deliveries
- **For Restaurant Owners**: Manage menus, process orders, update restaurant information
- **For Administrators**: Oversee the entire platform, manage users and restaurants

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Node.js installed on your system
- MongoDB database connection
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection

### Understanding the App Structure
The app consists of:
- **Backend API**: Handles all data processing and business logic
- **Database**: Stores user data, restaurant info, menus, and orders
- **Authentication System**: Manages user login and security

## User Authentication

### Creating a New Account (Registration)

**Step 1: Access Registration**
- Navigate to the registration endpoint
- The system will ask for your personal information

**Step 2: Fill Required Information**
```json
{
  "name": "Your Full Name",
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "address": "Your complete address"
}
```

**Step 3: What Happens Next**
- The system creates your account
- Your password gets encrypted for security
- You receive a success confirmation
- You can now log in with your credentials

**Important Notes for Beginners:**
- Use a strong password (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- Your email must be unique - no duplicate accounts allowed
- Keep your login credentials safe

### Logging Into Your Account

**Step 1: Prepare Your Credentials**
- Have your registered email address ready
- Remember your password

**Step 2: Send Login Request**
```json
{
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "YourPassword123"
}
```

**Step 3: Receive Your Access Token**
- The system verifies your credentials
- You get a JWT (JSON Web Token) - think of it as your digital key
- This token proves you're logged in for future requests
- Token expires after some time for security

**What is a JWT Token?**
- It's like a digital ID card
- You need to include it in requests that require login
- It contains your user information securely encoded
- When it expires, you'll need to log in again

### Password Security
**For Beginners - How Password Protection Works:**
1. When you create a password, the system doesn't store it directly
2. It uses "bcrypt" to scramble (hash) your password
3. Even if someone sees the database, they can't read your actual password
4. When you log in, the system compares the scrambled versions

## Menu Management

### Understanding Menu Structure

**What is a Menu Item?**
Every food item in the app has these details:
- **Name**: What the dish is called
- **Description**: Details about the dish
- **Price**: How much it costs

## API Usage Guide

### Understanding APIs for Beginners

**What is an API?**
- API stands for Application Programming Interface
- Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant
- You (the customer) tell the waiter (API) what you want
- The waiter takes your request to the kitchen (database)
- The kitchen prepares your order and sends it back through the waiter

**How This Restaurant App API Works:**
- You send requests to specific web addresses (endpoints)
- Each endpoint does a specific job
- You get responses back with the information you requested
- Some endpoints require you to be logged in (authentication)

### Authentication Endpoints

## Database Operations

### Understanding the Database Structure

**For Beginners - What is a Database?**
- Think of it as a digital filing cabinet
- It stores all information about users, restaurants, menus, and orders
- Data is organized in "collections" (like folders)
- Each collection contains "documents" (like individual files)

**Main Collections in Our App:**

1. **Users Collection**
   - Stores customer and restaurant owner accounts
   - Contains names, emails, encrypted passwords, addresses
   - Each user has a unique ID

2. **Restaurants Collection**
   - Stores restaurant profiles and information
   - Contains names, addresses, operating hours, contact info
   - Each restaurant has a unique ID

3. **Menu Items Collection**
   - Stores all food items available for order
   - Contains names, descriptions, prices, categories
   - Links to specific restaurants

4. **Orders Collection**
   - Stores all customer orders
   - Contains items ordered, quantities, total prices, status
   - Links customers to restaurants and menu items

### How Data Connects (Relationships)

**For Beginners - Understanding Connections:**

**User → Orders**
- One customer can have many orders
- Each order belongs to one customer
- We connect them using the customer's user ID

**Restaurant → Menu Items**
- One restaurant can have many menu items
- Each menu item belongs to one restaurant
- We connect them using the restaurant's ID

**Restaurant → Orders**
- One restaurant can receive many orders
- Each order is placed at one restaurant
- We connect them using the restaurant's ID

**Orders → Menu Items**
- One order can contain many menu items
- One menu item can appear in many orders
- We store the item details within each order

### Data Validation

**What is Data Validation?**
- The system checks if information is correct before saving
- Prevents errors and keeps data clean
- Ensures required information is provided

**Examples of Validation:**

**User Registration Validation:**
- Email must be in proper email format
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Phone number must contain only digits
- All required fields must be filled

**Menu Item Validation:**
- Price must be a positive number
- Name cannot be empty
- Category must be from allowed list
- Restaurant ID must exist in the system

**Order Validation:**
- Customer must be logged in
- All ordered items must exist and be available
- Quantities must be positive numbers
- Delivery address cannot be empty

### Data Security

**How We Protect Your Information:**

**Password Protection:**
- Passwords are "hashed" (scrambled) before storage
- Even database administrators can't see actual passwords
- Uses bcrypt encryption (industry standard)

**User Authentication:**
- JWT tokens expire after a set time
- Sensitive operations require valid authentication
- Users can only access their own data

**Input Sanitization:**
- All user input is cleaned before processing
- Prevents malicious code injection
- Validates data types and formats

### Order-Related Issues

**"Cannot place order"**
**Step-by-step troubleshooting:**

1. **Check login status**: Must be logged in to place orders
2. **Verify item availability**: All items must be currently available
3. **Confirm restaurant is open**: Check operating hours
4. **Valid delivery address**: Must provide complete address
5. **Minimum order amount**: Order total must meet restaurant's minimum

**"Order status not updating"**
**What to check:**

**"Cannot cancel order"**
**Why this happens:**
