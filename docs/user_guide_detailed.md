## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Node.js installed on your system
- MongoDB database connection
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection

### Understanding the App Structure
The app consists of:
- **Backend API**: Handles all data processing and business logic
- **Database**: Stores user data, restaurant info, menus, and orders
- **Authentication System**: Manages user login and security

## User Authentication

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant A as API
    participant D as Database
    participant T as Token Service
    
    Note over U,T: Registration Process
    U->>A: POST /api/auth/register
    A->>A: Validate user data
    A->>D: Check if email exists
    D-->>A: Email availability
    A->>A: Hash password
    A->>D: Save new user
    D-->>A: User created
    A-->>U: Success response
    
    Note over U,T: Login Process
    U->>A: POST /api/auth/login
    A->>D: Find user by email
    D-->>A: User data
    A->>A: Compare passwords
    A->>T: Generate JWT token
    T-->>A: JWT token
    A-->>U: Token + user info
```

### Creating a New Account (Registration)

**Step 1: Access Registration**
- Navigate to the registration endpoint
- The system will ask for your personal information

**Step 2: Fill Required Information**
```json
{
  "name": "Your Full Name",
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "address": "Your complete address"
}
```

**Step 3: What Happens Next**
- The system creates your account
- Your password gets encrypted for security
- You receive a success confirmation
- You can now log in with your credentials

**Important Notes for Beginners:**
- Use a strong password (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- Your email must be unique - no duplicate accounts allowed
- Keep your login credentials safe

### Password Security Process

```mermaid

    A[User enters password] --> B[System receives password]
    B --> C[Generate salt]
    C --> D[Hash password with bcrypt]
    D --> E[Store hashed password in database]
    
    F[User logs in] --> G[System receives login attempt]
    G --> H[Retrieve stored hash from database]
    H --> I[Compare entered password with stored hash]
    I --> J{Passwords match?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Login successful]
    J -->|No| L[Login failed]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style K fill:#e8f5e8
    style L fill:#ffebee
```

### Logging Into Your Account

**Step 1: Prepare Your Credentials**
- Have your registered email address ready
- Remember your password

**Step 2: Send Login Request**
```json
{
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "YourPassword123"
}
```

**Step 3: Receive Your Access Token**
- The system verifies your credentials
- You get a JWT (JSON Web Token) - think of it as your digital key
- This token proves you're logged in for future requests
- Token expires after some time for security

**What is a JWT Token?**
- It's like a digital ID card
- You need to include it in requests that require login
- It contains your user information securely encoded
- When it expires, you'll need to log in again

## Menu Management

### Menu Item Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Create new item
    Draft --> Available: Set as available
    Available --> Unavailable: Mark unavailable
    Unavailable --> Available: Mark available again
    Available --> Updated: Modify details
    Updated --> Available: Save changes
    Available --> Deleted: Remove item
    Unavailable --> Deleted: Remove item
    Deleted --> [*]
    
    note right of Available: Customers can order
    note right of Unavailable: Hidden from customers
    note right of Deleted: Permanently removed
```

### Understanding Menu Structure

**What is a Menu Item?**
Every food item in the app has these details:
- **Name**: What the dish is called
- **Description**: Details about the dish
- **Price**: How much it costs
- **Category**: Type of food (appetizer, main course, dessert)
- **Image**: Picture of the dish
- **Availability**: Whether it's currently available
- **Restaurant**: Which restaurant serves it

### Menu Management Flow

```mermaid

    style F fill:#e8f5e8
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
    style M fill:#ffebee
    style O fill:#fff3e0
```

### Adding a New Menu Item (For Restaurant Owners)

**Step 1: Prepare Your Item Information**
```json
{
  "name": "Margherita Pizza",
  "description": "Fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves",
  "price": 12.99,
  "category": "Pizza",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/pizza-image.jpg",
  "isAvailable": true,
  "restaurantId": "restaurant_id_here"
}
```

**Step 2: Understanding Each Field**
- **Name**: Keep it simple and appetizing
- **Description**: Help customers understand what they're ordering
- **Price**: Always use decimal format (12.99, not 13)
- **Category**: Helps customers find items easily
- **ImageUrl**: A link to an appetizing photo
- **isAvailable**: Set to false if temporarily out of stock
- **restaurantId**: Links the item to your restaurant

**Step 3: What Happens When You Add an Item**
- The system saves it to the database
- Customers can immediately see it in your menu
- You can edit or remove it later if needed

### Viewing Menu Items

**For Customers - Browsing Menus:**
1. **View All Items**: See everything available
2. **Filter by Restaurant**: See only items from specific restaurants
3. **Filter by Category**: Find appetizers, main courses, etc.
4. **Check Availability**: Only available items can be ordered

**For Restaurant Owners - Managing Your Menu:**
- View all your menu items
- See which items are popular
- Update prices or descriptions
- Mark items as unavailable temporarily

## Order Management

### Understanding Orders

**What is an Order?**
An order contains:
- **Customer Information**: Who placed the order
- **Items Ordered**: What food items and quantities
- **Total Amount**: How much the order costs
- **Status**: Current stage of the order
- **Timestamps**: When it was placed, updated, etc.

### Order Status Explained for Beginners

1. **Pending**: Just placed, waiting for restaurant confirmation
2. **Confirmed**: Restaurant accepted and is preparing
3. **Preparing**: Food is being cooked
4. **Ready**: Food is ready for pickup/delivery
5. **Out for Delivery**: Driver has picked up the order
6. **Delivered**: Customer has received the order
7. **Cancelled**: Order was cancelled for some reason

### Placing an Order (For Customers)

{
  "customerId": "your_user_id",
  "restaurantId": "restaurant_id",
  "items": [
    {
      "menuItemId": "item_id_1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "specialInstructions": "Extra spicy please"
    },
    {
      "menuItemId": "item_id_2", 
      "quantity": 1,
      "specialInstructions": "No onions"
    }
  ],
  "deliveryAddress": "Your complete delivery address"
}
```

**Step 2: Understanding Order Details**
- **customerId**: Your unique user identifier
- **restaurantId**: Which restaurant you're ordering from
- **items**: Array of what you want to order
- **quantity**: How many of each item
- **specialInstructions**: Any custom requests

### Understanding Restaurant Profiles

**What Makes a Restaurant Profile:**
- **Basic Information**: Name, description, cuisine type
- **Contact Details**: Phone, email, address
- **Operating Hours**: When the restaurant is open
- **Delivery Areas**: Where they deliver food
- **Rating System**: Customer reviews and ratings
- **Menu Association**: All their food items

### Adding a New Restaurant

**Step 1: Basic Information Setup**
```json
{
  "name": "Mario's Italian Kitchen",
  "description": "Authentic Italian cuisine with fresh ingredients",
  "cuisineType": "Italian",
  "address": "123 Main Street, Downtown",
  "phone": "555-0123",
  "email": "info@marios.com"
}
```

**Step 2: Operating Hours**
```json
{
  "operatingHours": {
    "monday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "22:00" },
    "tuesday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "22:00" },
    "wednesday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "22:00" },
    "thursday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "22:00" },
    "friday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "23:00" },
    "saturday": { "open": "11:00", "close": "23:00" },
    "sunday": { "open": "12:00", "close": "21:00" }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Delivery Information**
```json
{
  "deliveryFee": 2.99,
  "minimumOrderAmount": 15.00,
  "estimatedDeliveryTime": "30-45 minutes",
  "deliveryRadius": "5 miles"
}
```

## API Usage Guide

### API Request/Response Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client App
    participant API as API Server
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    Client->>API: HTTP Request
    API->>Auth: Validate token (if required)
    Auth-->>API: Token valid/invalid
    
    alt Token valid or public endpoint
        API->>API: Process request
        API->>DB: Database operation
        DB-->>API: Data result
        API-->>Client: Success response
    else Token invalid
        API-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    else Request invalid
        API-->>Client: 400 Bad Request
    else Server error
        API-->>Client: 500 Internal Server Error
    end
```

### Understanding APIs for Beginners

**What is an API?**
- API stands for Application Programming Interface
- Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant
- You (the customer) tell the waiter (API) what you want
- The waiter takes your request to the kitchen (database)
- The kitchen prepares your order and sends it back through the waiter

### API Endpoints Overview

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Restaurant API))
    Authentication
      POST /api/auth/register
      POST /api/auth/login
    Menu Management
      GET /api/menu
      POST /api/menu
      PUT /api/menu/:id
      DELETE /api/menu/:id
    Order Management
      POST /api/orders
      GET /api/orders/user/:userId
      GET /api/orders/restaurant/:restaurantId
      PUT /api/orders/:id/status
      DELETE /api/orders/:id
    Restaurant Management
      GET /api/restaurants
      POST /api/restaurants
      PUT /api/restaurants/:id
      GET /api/restaurants/:id
```

**How This Restaurant App API Works:**
- You send requests to specific web addresses (endpoints)
- Each endpoint does a specific job
- You get responses back with the information you requested
- Some endpoints require you to be logged in (authentication)

### Authentication Endpoints

**Registration Endpoint**
```
POST /api/auth/register
```
**What it does**: Creates a new user account
**Who can use it**: Anyone (public endpoint)
**What to send**: Name, email, password, phone, address
**What you get back**: Success message and user information

**Login Endpoint**  
```
POST /api/auth/login
```
**What it does**: Logs you into your account
**Who can use it**: Anyone with valid credentials
**What to send**: Email and password
**What you get back**: JWT token for future requests

### Menu Endpoints

**Get All Menu Items**
```
GET /api/menu
```
**Add New Menu Item**
```
POST /api/menu
```
**Update Menu Item**
```
PUT /api/menu/:id
```
**Delete Menu Item**
```

### Understanding the Database Structure

**For Beginners - What is a Database?**
- Think of it as a digital filing cabinet
- It stores all information about users, restaurants, menus, and orders
- Data is organized in "collections" (like folders)
- Each collection contains "documents" (like individual files)

**Main Collections in Our App:**

1. **Users Collection**
   - Stores customer and restaurant owner accounts
   - Contains names, emails, encrypted passwords, addresses
   - Each user has a unique ID

2. **Restaurants Collection**
   - Stores restaurant profiles and information
   - Contains names, addresses, operating hours, contact info
   - Each restaurant has a unique ID

3. **Menu Items Collection**
   - Stores all food items available for order
   - Contains names, descriptions, prices, categories
   - Links to specific restaurants

4. **Orders Collection**
   - Stores all customer orders
   - Contains items ordered, quantities, total prices, status
   - Links customers to restaurants and menu items
