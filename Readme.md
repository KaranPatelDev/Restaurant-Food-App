## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

Our system is designed with a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. Each layer has a distinct responsibility, from handling raw HTTP requests to interacting with the database.

### High-Level Architecture Overview

The diagram below illustrates the major components of the system and how they interact.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        A[Mobile Apps] 
        B[Web Applications]
        C[Admin Dashboard]
        D[Restaurant Interface]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Gateway"
        E[Express.js Server]
        F[CORS Middleware]
        G[Authentication Middleware]
        H[Request Logging]
    end
    
    subgraph "Business Logic Layer"
        I[User Controller]
        J[Food Controller]
        K[Restaurant Controller]
        L[Order Controller]
        M[Auth Controller]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Access Layer"
        N[Mongoose ODM]
        O[User Model]
        P[Food Model]
        Q[Restaurant Model]
        R[Order Model]
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Layer"
        S[(MongoDB)]
        T[(User Collection)]
        U[(Food Collection)]
        V[(Restaurant Collection)]
        W[(Order Collection)]
    end
    
    A --> E; B --> E; C --> E; D --> E
    E --> F --> G --> H
    H --> I; H --> J; H --> K; H --> L; H --> M
    I --> N; J --> N; K --> N; L --> N; M --> N
    N --> O; N --> P; N --> Q; N --> R
    O --> S; P --> S; Q --> S; R --> S
    S --> T; S --> U; S --> V; S --> W
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style S fill:#ffebee
```

-   **Client Layer**: Represents the various frontend applications that consume our API. This can include customer-facing mobile/web apps, restaurant management panels, and admin dashboards.
-   **API Gateway**: The entry point for all client requests. The Express.js server, along with its middleware, handles routing, security (CORS, Authentication), and logging before passing the request to the appropriate controller.
-   **Business Logic Layer**: This is where the core application logic resides. Controllers receive requests, validate inputs, and orchestrate the necessary operations to fulfill the request.
-   **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: This layer abstracts the database interactions. We use Mongoose as an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) to define schemas (Models) and interact with MongoDB in a structured way.
-   **Database Layer**: The persistence layer where all application data is stored. We use MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, which provides flexibility and scalability.

### Request Flow Architecture

This sequence diagram shows the journey of a single HTTP request through the system, from the client to the database and back.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as üì± Client App
    participant Middleware as üîí Middleware Stack
    participant Controller as üéÆ Controller
    participant Model as üìä Mongoose Model
    participant Database as üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB
    
    Note over Client,Database: Complete Request Lifecycle
    
    Client->>Middleware: HTTP Request
    Middleware->>Middleware: CORS Check & Body Parsing
    
    alt Protected Route
        Middleware->>Middleware: JWT Validation
        Middleware->>Controller: Authenticated Request
    else Public Route
        Middleware->>Controller: Direct Request
    end
    
    Controller->>Controller: Input Validation & Business Logic
    Controller->>Model: Database Operation (e.g., find, create)
    Model->>Database: Query Execution
    Database-->>Model: Query Result
    Model-->>Controller: Processed Data
    
    alt Success
        Controller->>Client: 200/201 Success Response
    else Error
        Controller->>Client: 4xx/5xx Error Response
    end
```

The flow demonstrates how middleware acts as a gatekeeper, performing checks before the controller handles the core logic. The controller then uses the model to perform database operations, and finally, a response is sent back to the client.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

We've chosen a modern, robust, and widely-supported technology stack based on JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.

### Core Technologies

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Runtime Environment"
        A[Node.js v18+] --> B[JavaScript V8 Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Web Framework"
        C[Express.js] --> D[Middleware System]
        C --> E[Routing Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Stack"
        G[MongoDB] --> H[Document Database]
        I[Mongoose] --> J[ODM Layer & Schema Validation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Authentication"
        L[JWT] --> M[Token-based Auth]
        N[bcryptjs] --> O[Password Hashing]
    end
    
    style A fill:#68a063
    style C fill:#000000,color:#ffffff
    style G fill:#47a248
    style L fill:#000000,color:#ffffff
```

### Why this stack?

-   **Node.js & Express.js**: Provide a fast, non-blocking I/O model that is perfect for data-intensive, real-time applications. Express.js simplifies API development with its minimalist and flexible framework.
-   **MongoDB & Mongoose**: A NoSQL document database like MongoDB offers great flexibility for evolving data structures. Mongoose adds a layer of structure with schemas, validation, and business logic hooks, giving us the best of both worlds.
-   **JWT & bcryptjs**: For security, JWT provides a stateless, token-based authentication mechanism ideal for RESTful APIs. We never store plain-text passwords; instead, we use `bcryptjs` to hash them securely.

## üìä Database Design

The database schema is designed to be efficient and scalable, capturing all the necessary relationships between users, restaurants, foods, and orders.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This diagram visualizes the database collections (entities) and the relationships between them.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String userName
        String email UK
        String password
        String[] address
        String phone
        String userType "client|vendor|admin|driver"
        String profile "avatar URL"
    }
    
    RESTAURANT {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String title
        String imageUrl
        String time "operating hours"
        Boolean isOpen
        String logoUrl
        ObjectId owner FK
    }
    
    FOOD {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String title
        String description
        Number price
        String imageUrl
        String[] foodTags
        ObjectId category FK
        Boolean isAvailable
        ObjectId restaurant FK
    }
    
    CATEGORY {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String title
        String imageUrl
    }
    
    ORDER {
        ObjectId _id PK
        ObjectId[] foods FK
        Number payment
        ObjectId buyer FK
        String status "preparing|prepare|on_the_way|delivered"
    }
    
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    USER ||--|{ RESTAURANT : owns
    RESTAURANT ||--o{ FOOD : serves
    CATEGORY ||--o{ FOOD : categorizes
    FOOD }o--|| ORDER : included_in
```

### Data Models Explained

-   **User**: Stores information about all users, including customers, restaurant owners, and admins. The `userType` field is crucial for role-based access control.
-   **Restaurant**: Contains details about each restaurant, such as its name, location, and operating hours. It's linked to a `User` (the owner).
-   **Food**: Represents an individual food item on a menu. It's linked to a `Restaurant` and a `Category`.
-   **Category**: Helps organize food items (e.g., "Pizza", "Desserts", "Drinks").
-   **Order**: Tracks an order placed by a `User`. It contains a list of `Food` items, the total payment, and the current `status` of the order.

## üîê Authentication Flow

Security is paramount. Our authentication flow uses JWT for stateless, secure access to protected resources.

### JWT Authentication Process

The process begins with registration and login, where a user receives a JWT. This token must then be included in the header of all subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as üë§ User
    participant Client as üì± Client App
    participant API as üîß API Server
    participant Auth as üîê Auth Service
    participant DB as üóÑÔ∏è Database
    
    Note over User,DB: User Login Flow
    User->>Client: Enter Login Credentials
    Client->>API: POST /api/v1/auth/login
    API->>DB: Find User by Email
    
    alt User Found
        DB-->>API: User Data (with hashed password)
        API->>Auth: Compare Plain Password with Hash
        
        alt Password Valid
            Auth-->>API: Password Match
            API->>Auth: Generate JWT Token (with user ID & role)
            Auth-->>API: JWT Token
            API-->>Client: 200 OK + { token: "...", user: {...} }
            Client->>Client: Store JWT Token securely
        else Password Invalid
            Auth-->>API: Password Mismatch
            API-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid Credentials
        end
    else User Not Found
        DB-->>API: No User Found
        API-->>Client: 404 Not Found - User not found
    end
```

### Token Validation Middleware

For every request to a protected route, our authentication middleware automatically validates the JWT.

```mermaid

## üì¶ Order Management

The order management system is the heart of the application, tracking an order from creation to completion.

### Order Lifecycle State Machine

This state diagram illustrates the possible states of an order and the transitions between them.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending : Customer places order
    
    Pending --> Confirmed : Restaurant accepts
    Pending --> Cancelled : Restaurant/Customer cancels
    
    Confirmed --> Preparing : Kitchen starts cooking
    
    Preparing --> ReadyForPickup : Food is prepared
    ReadyForPickup --> OutForDelivery : Driver picks up order
    
    OutForDelivery --> Delivered : Customer receives order
    
    Cancelled --> [*]
    Delivered --> [*]
    
    note right of Pending
        Awaiting restaurant confirmation.
    end note
    
    note right of Confirmed
        Order accepted.
        Kitchen can start preparing.
    end note
    
    note right of OutForDelivery
        Driver is en route to the customer.
        Real-time tracking can be enabled.
    end note
    
    note left of Delivered
        Order successfully completed.
        Payment is finalized.
    end note
```

### Order Processing Flow

This sequence diagram details the interactions between all parties during the order process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer as üë§ Customer
    participant API as üîß API Server
    participant Restaurant as üè™ Restaurant
    participant DB as üóÑÔ∏è Database
    
    Customer->>API: POST /api/v1/food/placeorder (with JWT)
    API->>API: Validate cart & calculate total
    API->>DB: Create Order (status: "Pending")
    API-->>Customer: 201 Created - Order placed
    API->>Restaurant: üìß Notification: New Order
    
    Restaurant->>API: PUT /api/v1/food/orderStatus/:id (status: "Confirmed")
    API->>DB: Update Order status
    API-->>Customer: üì± Notification: Order Confirmed
    
    Restaurant->>API: PUT /api/v1/food/orderStatus/:id (status: "Preparing")
    API->>DB: Update Order status

### Detailed Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**: This command installs all the packages listed in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**: Your application's configuration is stored in environment variables.
    ```bash
    # Create a .env file by copying the template
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and set the following variables:
    ```env
    # Server Port
    PORT=8080

    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/restaurant_food_app

    # A long, random, and secret string for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**: This command starts the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should see the following output in your terminal:
    ```
    üöÄ Server running on port 8080
    üìä MongoDB connected successfully
    ```

## üß™ Testing

We use Postman for manual API testing and Newman for automated integration testing. A Postman collection is included in the `/postman` directory.

### Testing Strategy

Our strategy covers manual and automated testing to ensure API reliability.

    Automated Testing
      Newman CLI
        Run Postman collection in CI/CD
        Generate test reports
```

### Running Tests with Newman

Newman is a command-line runner for Postman collections. It allows you to run your tests from the terminal, making it ideal for automation.

1.  **Install Newman**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g newman
    ```

2.  **Run the Collection**: Execute the following command from the project root to run all tests.
    ```bash
    # Make sure to have your server running first!
    newman run postman/collection.json --environment postman/environment.json
    ```
